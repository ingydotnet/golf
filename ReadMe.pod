=head1 Name

golf - Go; less f**kery

=head1 Synopsis

    echo '-> "Hello, world"' > hello.golf
    golf --compile hello.golf
    go run hello.go

=head1 Description

Golf is to Go as CoffeeScript is to JavaScript.

Go is a modern language with a fairly arcane and arbitrary syntax. Golf lets
you write Go programs in a different syntax, that leans heavily towards doing
more with less.
